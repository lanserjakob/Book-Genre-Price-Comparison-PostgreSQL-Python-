# Book-Genre-Price-Comparison-PostgreSQL-Python-
A small data engineering project for collecting and comparing book prices across genres and online shops.

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a relational database in PostgreSQL to store and compare book prices by genre across multiple online stores.
It also includes a Python component that can fetch (or simulate) real price data and insert it into the database.

# Project goals
- Practice database design with foreign keys and relational structure.
- Use PostgreSQL to store and query book pricing data.
- Integrate Python for data collection and insertion.
- Perform SQL queries to analyze pricing differences by genre and store.
